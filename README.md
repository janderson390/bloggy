# Bloggy
The name of our product is Bloggy. It will be a blog website that allows 
for user’s to create a profile, and write blogs to a ‘home page’ that 
will display the users blog to other user’s. The thing that will make our 
blog ‘Bloggy’ different from other blogs is that our blog will have a header that will have a topic of the day. The topic will change daily, 
which will spark conversations between users! The end goal is to foster a 
community that is open minded and willing to talk civilly about all 
topics.
